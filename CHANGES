v 0.1   - initial release

v 0.1.2 - changed wrapper to look for "Save Complete" when backing up instead of pausing and hoping the save-all is done. 
		- Added tagging to the git repository

v 0.1.3	- Fixed wrapper to look for "Save Complete" (was looking for an incorrect string, oops!) 
		- Cleaned up debug mode
		- updated README file to include the debug options and version info
