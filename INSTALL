Installation

To install you'll need to have root access to your server. 
If you don't, you'll need to bribe your admin. Money is 
best. Pizza may work if your particular admin is hungry.

If you're running a redhat or redhat based system these instructions
will probably work for you. 

1. Untar the release archive or checkout the latest git repository
   (I'm assuming you already did this or you would be reading 
   this file!)
2. Become root
3. Change directory to the folder that you untar-ed
   (cd /path/to/untarred/mc-wrapper-version)
4. Install the Proc::Daemon and IPC::Open2 perl modules
   (best is to use CPAN to get the latest version. Though
   they may be available from your yum repositories)
5. Run the following commands:

mkdir /usr/minecraft
useradd -M -d /usr/minecraft -s /sbin/nologin minecraft
mv minecraft.config /etc/sysconfig/minecraft
mv minecraft.init /etc/init.d/minecraft
mv bin/ /usr/minecraft
cd /usr/minecraft
mkdir backup
chown -R minecraft.minecraft .
chmod 755 bin/*
./bin/update_minecraft.sh
chkconfig --add minecraft 
service minecraft start

*NOTE* if you already have the minecraft_server.jar and a world
you'd like to use them copy the jar and the world into the 
/usr/minecraft folder. 

If you're on some other distro you may need to modify the 
minecraft.init script to suite your needs. Check out the 
README for information on signals used by the wrapper and
environment variables for configuration.
